 * @brief   Image interface
 *
 * @details This file contains a interface which is currently used by the
 * classes RootImage and SampleImage. In the future, we will be switching to
 * another openCV library for the Nvidea Jetson. This library works a tad bit
 * different and does not share same named functions and classes. By
 * implementing this interface in another class you are able to change the Image
 * functionality, without changing the base code.
